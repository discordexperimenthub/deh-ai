# Discord Developer Portal — Documentation — Application Commands

## Application Commands

Application commands are native ways to interact with apps in the Discord client. There are 3 types of commands accessible in different interfaces: the chat input, a message's context menu (top-right menu or right-clicking in a message), and a user's context menu (right-clicking on a user).

![Client interfaces showing the different types of application commands](https://ptb.discord.com/assets/d912a955d79aada8839222b2a12e4633.png)

## Application Command Object

## Application Command Naming

```CHAT_INPUT``` command names and command option names must match the following regex ```^[-_\p{L}\p{N}\p{sc=Deva}\p{sc=Thai}]{1,32}$``` with the unicode flag set. If there is a lowercase variant of any letters used, you must use those. Characters with no lowercase variants and/or uncased letters are still allowed. ```USER``` and ```MESSAGE``` commands may be mixed case and can include spaces.

## Application Command Structure

| Field | Type | Description | Valid Types |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | Unique ID of command | all |
| type? | one of [application command type](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-types) | [Type of command](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-types), defaults to ```1``` | all |
| application\_id | snowflake | ID of the parent application | all |
| guild\_id? | snowflake | Guild ID of the command, if not global | all |
| name | string | [Name of command](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-naming), 1-32 characters | all |
| name\_localizations? | ?dictionary with keys in [available locales](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) | Localization dictionary for ```name``` field. Values follow the same restrictions as ```name``` | all |
| description | string | Description for ```CHAT_INPUT``` commands, 1-100 characters. Empty string for ```USER``` and ```MESSAGE``` commands | all |
| description\_localizations? | ?dictionary with keys in [available locales](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) | Localization dictionary for ```description``` field. Values follow the same restrictions as ```description``` | all |
| options? | array of [application command option](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-option-structure) | Parameters for the command, max of 25 | CHAT\_INPUT |
| default\_member\_permissions | ?string | Set of [permissions](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) represented as a bit set | all |
| dm\_permission? | boolean | Indicates whether the command is available in DMs with the app, only for globally-scoped commands. By default, commands are visible. | all |
| default\_permission? | ?boolean | Not recommended for use as field will soon be deprecated. Indicates whether the command is enabled by default when the app is added to a guild, defaults to ```true``` | all |
| nsfw? | boolean | Indicates whether the command is [age-restricted](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#agerestricted-commands), defaults to ```false``` | all |
| version | snowflake | Autoincrementing version identifier updated during substantial record changes | all |

```default_permission``` will soon be deprecated. You can instead set ```default_member_permissions``` to ```"0"``` to disable the command for everyone except admins by default, and/or set ```dm_permission``` to ```false``` to disable globally-scoped commands inside of DMs with your app

\* Type of ```value``` depends on the [option type](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-option-type) that the choice belongs to.

## Authorizing Your Application

Application commands do not depend on a bot user in the guild; they use the [interactions](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding) model. To create commands in a guild, your app must be authorized with the ```applications.commands``` scope which can be used independently, but is also automatically included with the ```bot``` scope.

When requesting this scope, we "shortcut" the OAuth2 flow similar to adding a bot. You don't need to complete the flow, exchange for a token, or any of that.

If your application does not require a bot user in the guild for its commands to work, you don't need to add the bot scope or a permission bitfield to the URL.

## Registering a Command

Commands can only be registered via HTTP endpoint.

Commands can be scoped either globally or to a specific guild. Global commands are available for every guild that adds your app. An individual app's global commands are also available in DMs if that app has a bot that shares a mutual guild with the user.

Guild commands are specific to the guild you specify when making them. Guild commands are not available in DMs. Command names are unique per application, per type, within each scope (global and guild). That means:

*   Your app cannot have two global ```CHAT_INPUT``` commands with the same name
*   Your app cannot have two guild ```CHAT_INPUT``` commands within the same name on the same guild
*   Your app cannot have two global ```USER``` commands with the same name
*   Your app can have a global and guild ```CHAT_INPUT``` command with the same name
*   Your app can have a global ```CHAT_INPUT``` and ```USER``` command with the same name
*   Multiple apps can have commands with the same names

This list is non-exhaustive. In general, remember that command names must be unique per application, per type, and within each scope (global and guild).

An app can have the following number of commands:

*   100 global ```CHAT_INPUT``` commands
*   5 global ```USER``` commands
*   5 global ```MESSAGE``` commands

As well as the same amount of guild-specific commands per guild.

There is a global rate limit of 200 application command creates per day, per guild

## Making a Global Command

Global commands are available on all your app's guilds.

Global commands have inherent read-repair functionality. That means that if you make an update to a global command, and a user tries to use that command before it has updated for them, Discord will do an internal version check and reject the command, and trigger a reload for that command.

To make a global command, make an HTTP POST call like this:

```
import requests


url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/commands"

# This is an example CHAT_INPUT or Slash Command, with a type of 1
json = {
    "name": "blep",
    "type": 1,
    "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "animal",
            "description": "The type of animal",
            "type": 3,
            "required": True,
            "choices": [
                {
                    "name": "Dog",
                    "value": "animal_dog"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Cat",
                    "value": "animal_cat"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Penguin",
                    "value": "animal_penguin"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "only_smol",
            "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",
            "type": 5,
            "required": False
        }
    ]
}

# For authorization, you can use either your bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"
}

r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Making a Guild Command

Guild commands are available only within the guild specified on creation. Guild commands update instantly. We recommend you use guild commands for quick testing, and global commands when they're ready for public use.

To make a guild command, make a similar HTTP POST call, but scope it to a specific ```guild_id```:

```
import requests


url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands"

# This is an example USER command, with a type of 2
json = {
    "name": "High Five",
    "type": 2
}

# For authorization, you can use either your bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"
}

r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Updating and Deleting a Command

Commands can be deleted and updated by making ```DELETE``` and ```PATCH``` calls to the command endpoint. Those endpoints are

*   ```applications/<my_application_id>/commands/<command_id>``` for global commands, or
*   ```applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands/<command_id>``` for guild commands

Because commands have unique names within a type and scope, we treat ```POST``` requests for new commands as upserts. That means making a new command with an already-used name for your application will update the existing command.

Detailed documentation about application command endpoints and their parameters are [in the endpoints section](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#endpoints).

## Permissions

Application command permissions allow your app to enable or disable commands for up to 100 users, roles, and channels within a guild. Command permissions can also be updated by users in the client if they have the necessary permissions.

Command permissions can only be updated using a [Bearer token](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#client-credentials-grant). Authenticating with a bot token will result in an error.

A command's current permissions can be retrieved using the [```GET /applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/{command.id}/permissions```](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#get-application-command-permissions) endpoint. The response will include an array called ```permissions``` with associated IDs and permission types.

Command permissions can be updated with the [```PUT /applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/{command.id}/permissions```](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#edit-application-command-permissions) endpoint. To call the endpoint, apps must use a Bearer token that's authorized with the [```applications.commands.permissions.update```](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) scope from a user with sufficient permissions. For their permissions to be considered sufficient, all of the following must be true for the authenticating user (not your app or bot user):

*   Has [permission to Manage Guild and Manage Roles](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) in the guild where the command is being edited
*   Has the ability to run the command being edited
*   Has permission to manage the resources that will be affected (roles, users, and/or channels depending on the [permission types](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permission-type))

## Syncing and Unsyncing Permissions

This section only applies to the current permissions configuration behavior. It does not apply to guilds that are migrated to the new permissions configuration behavior (starting on December 16, 2022). Read more [in the changelog](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/change-log#upcoming-application-command-permission-changes).

The command permissions interface can be accessed in the client by navigating to ```Server Settings``` > ```Integrations```, then clicking ```Manage``` to the right of an installed app. At the top of the interface, users can edit permissions for a specific user, role, or channel. By default, these top-level permissions will apply to all of an app's commands. However, each permission can also be unsynced and customized for individual commands to provide more granular control.

When the permissions for a specific command are unsynced, meaning it doesn't align with the top-level permissions, the interface will display "Not Synced" to users.

## Application Command Permissions Object

## Guild Application Command Permissions Structure

Returned when fetching the permissions for an app's command(s) in a guild.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | ID of the command or the application ID |
| application\_id | snowflake | ID of the application the command belongs to |
| guild\_id | snowflake | ID of the guild |
| permissions | array of [application command permissions](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permissions-structure) | Permissions for the command in the guild, max of 100 |

When the ```id``` field is the application ID instead of a command ID, the permissions apply to all commands that do not contain explicit overwrites.

## Application Command Permissions Structure

Application command permissions allow you to enable or disable commands for specific users, roles, or channels within a guild.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | ID of the role, user, or channel. It can also be a [permission constant](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permissions-constants) |
| type | [application command permission type](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permission-type) | role (```1```), user (```2```), or channel (```3```) |
| permission | boolean | ```true``` to allow, ```false```, to disallow |

## Application Command Permissions Constants

The following constants can be used in the ```id``` field for command permissions payloads.

| Permission | Value | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ```@everyone``` | ```guild_id``` | snowflake | All members in a guild |
| All Channels | ```guild_id - 1``` | snowflake | All channels in a guild |

## Application Command Permission Type

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ROLE | 1 |
| USER | 2 |
| CHANNEL | 3 |

To allow for fine-tuned access to commands, application command permissions are supported for guild and global commands of all types. Guild members and apps with the [necessary permissions](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#permissions) can allow or deny specific users and roles from using a command, or toggle commands for entire channels.

Similar to how threads [inherit user and role permissions from the parent channel](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/topics/threads#permissions), any command permissions for a channel will apply to the threads it contains.

If you don't have permission to use a command, it will not show up in the command picker. Members with the Administrator permission can use all commands.

## Using Default Permissions

Default permissions can be added to a command during creation using the ```default_member_permissions``` and ```dm_permission``` fields. Adding default permissions doesn't require any Bearer token since it's configured during command creation and isn't targeting specific roles, users, or channels.

The ```default_member_permissions``` field can be used when creating a command to set the permissions a user must have to use it. The value for ```default_member_permissions``` is a bitwise OR-ed set of [permissions](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags), serialized as a string. Setting it to ```"0"``` will prohibit anyone in a guild from using the command unless a specific overwrite is configured or the user has admin permissions.

You can also use the ```dm_permission``` flag to control whether a global command can be run in DMs with your app. The ```dm_permission``` flag isn't available for guild commands.

## Example of editing permissions

As an example, the following command would not be usable by anyone except admins in any guilds by default:

```
{
    "name": "permissions_test",
    "description": "A test of default permissions",
    "type": 1,
    "default_member_permissions": "0"
}
```

Or this would enable it just for users that have the ```MANAGE_GUILD``` permission:

```
permissions = str(1 << 5)

command = {
    "name": "permissions_test",
    "description": "A test of default permissions",
    "type": 1,
    "default_member_permissions": permissions
}
```

And the following would disable a command for a specific channel:

```
A_SPECIFIC_CHANNEL = "<channel_id>"
url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<application_id>/guilds/<my_guild_id>/commands/<my_command_id>/permissions"

json = {
    "permissions": [
        {
            "id": A_SPECIFIC_CHANNEL,
            "type": 3,
            "permission": False
        }
    ]
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_bearer_token>"
}

r = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Slash Commands

Slash commands—the ```CHAT_INPUT``` type—are a type of application command. They're made up of a name, description, and a block of ```options```, which you can think of like arguments to a function. The name and description help users find your command among many others, and the ```options``` validate user input as they fill out your command.

Slash commands can also have groups and subcommands to further organize commands. More on those later.

Slash commands can have a maximum of 4000 characters for combined name, description, and value properties for each command, its options (including subcommands and groups), and choices. When [localization fields](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#localization) are present, only the longest localization for each field (including the default value) is counted towards the size limit.

## Example Slash Command

```
{
    "name": "blep",
    "type": 1,
    "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "animal",
            "description": "The type of animal",
            "type": 3,
            "required": true,
            "choices": [
                {
                    "name": "Dog",
                    "value": "animal_dog"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Cat",
                    "value": "animal_cat"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Penguin",
                    "value": "animal_penguin"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "only_smol",
            "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",
            "type": 5,
            "required": false
        }
    ]
}
```

When someone uses a slash command, your application will receive an interaction:

## Example Interaction

}
```

## Subcommands and Subcommand Groups

Currently, subcommands and subcommand groups all appear at the top level in the command explorer. This may change in the future to include them as nested autocomplete options.

For those developers looking to make more organized and complex groups of commands, look no further than subcommands and groups.

Subcommands organize your commands by specifying actions within a command or group.

Subcommand Groups organize your subcommands by grouping subcommands by similar action or resource within a command.

These are not enforced rules. You are free to use subcommands and groups however you'd like; it's just how we think about them.

Using subcommands or subcommand groups will make your base command unusable. You can't send the base ```/permissions``` command as a valid command if you also have ```/permissions add | remove``` as subcommands or subcommand groups

We support nesting one level deep within a group, meaning your top level command can contain subcommand groups, and those groups can contain subcommands. That is the only kind of nesting supported. Here's some visual examples:

```
VALID

command
|
|__ subcommand
|
|__ subcommand

----

VALID

|
|__ subcommand-group
    |
    |__ subcommand

```

## Example Walkthrough

Let's look at an example. Let's imagine you run a moderation bot. You want to make a ```/permissions``` command that can do the following:

*   Get the guild permissions for a user or a role
*   Get the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel
*   Change the guild permissions for a user or a role
*   Change the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel

We'll start by defining the top-level information for ```/permissions```:

```
{

    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": []
}
```

![A command with no arguments. It says /permissions](https://ptb.discord.com/assets/a660b11b63a95e932719346ff67ea60f.png)

Now we have a command named ```permissions```. We want this command to be able to affect users and roles. Rather than making two separate commands, we can use subcommand groups. We want to use subcommand groups here because we are grouping commands on a similar resource: ```user``` or ```role```.

```
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",
            "type": 2 // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

You'll notice that a command like this will not show up in the command explorer. That's because groups are effectively "folders" for commands, and we've made two empty folders. So let's continue.

Now that we've effectively made ```user``` and ```role``` "folders", we want to be able to either ```get``` and ```edit``` permissions. Within the subcommand groups, we can make subcommands for ```get``` and ```edit```:

```
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",
            "type": 2, // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for a user",
                    "type": 1 // 1 is type SUB_COMMAND
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a user",
                    "type": 1
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2,
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

![A command with grouped subcommands. It says /permissions user get](https://ptb.discord.com/assets/4cfea1bfc6d3ed0396c16cd47e0a7154.png)

Now, we need some arguments! If we chose ```user```, we need to be able to pick a user; if we chose ```role```, we need to be able to pick a role. We also want to be able to pick between guild-level permissions and channel-specific permissions. For that, we can use optional arguments:

```

    "options": [
        {

            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",

                        },

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

And, done! The JSON looks a bit complicated, but what we've ended up with is a single command that can be scoped to multiple actions, and then further scoped to a particular resource, and then even further scope with optional arguments. Here's what it looks like all put together.

![A command with grouped subcommands and parameters. It says /permissions user get with arguments for a user and a channel.](https://ptb.discord.com/assets/5002338abeaf8532983a1be594a10683.png)

## User Commands

User commands are application commands that appear on the context menu (right click or tap) of users. They're a great way to surface quick actions for your app that target users. They don't take any arguments, and will return the user on whom you clicked or tapped in the interaction response.

A user must have permission to send text messages in the channel they invoke a user command in. If they don't have this permission, they will receive a 'Permission Denied' error from the interaction.

The ```description``` field is not allowed when creating user commands. However, to avoid breaking changes to data models, ```description``` will be an empty string (instead of ```null```) when fetching commands.

## Example User Command

```
{
    "name": "High Five",
    "type": 2
}
```

![An example user command. The context menu has an Apps section open to a High Five command](https://ptb.discord.com/assets/91848bf05f5aecd0e3ba2d009f6962fa.png)

When someone uses a user command, your application will receive an interaction:

## Message Commands

Message commands are application commands that appear on the context menu (right click or tap) of messages. They're a great way to surface quick actions for your app that target messages. They don't take any arguments, and will return the message on whom you clicked or tapped in the interaction response.

The ```description``` field is not allowed when creating message commands. However, to avoid breaking changes to data models, ```description``` will be an empty string (instead of ```null```) when fetching commands.

## Example Message Command

```
{
    "name": "Bookmark",
    "type": 3
}
```

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete interactions allow your application to dynamically return option suggestions to a user as they type.

An autocomplete interaction can return partial data for option values. Your application will receive partial data for any existing user input, as long as that input passes client-side validation. For example, you may receive partial strings, but not invalid numbers. The option the user is currently typing will be sent with a ```focused: true``` boolean field and options the user has already filled will also be sent but without the ```focused``` field. This is a special case where options that are otherwise required might not be present, due to the user not having filled them yet.

This validation is client-side only.

```
{
  "type": 4,
  "data": {
    "id": "816437322781949972",
    "name": "airhorn",
    "type": 1,
    "version": "847194950382780532",
    "options": [
      {
        "type": 3,
        "name": "variant",
        "value": "data a user is typ",
        "focused": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Localization

Application commands can be localized, which will cause them to use localized names and descriptions depending on the client's selected language. This is entirely optional. Localization is available for names and descriptions of commands, subcommands, and options, as well as the names of choices, by submitting the appropriate ```name_localizations``` and ```description_localizations``` fields when creating or updating the application command.

Application commands may be partially localized - not all [available locales](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) are required, nor do different fields within a command need to support the same set of locales. If a locale is not present in a localizations dictionary for a field, users in that locale will see the default value for that field. It's not necessary to fill out all locales with the default value. Any localized values that are identical to the default will be ignored.

Localized option names are subject to an additional constraint, which is that they must be distinct from all other default option names of that command, as well as all other option names within that locale on that command.

When taking advantage of command localization, the interaction payload received by your client will still use default command, subcommand, and option names. To localize your interaction response, you can determine the client's selected language by using the ```locale``` key in the interaction payload.

An application command furnished with localizations might look like this:

```
{
  "name": "birthday",
  "type": 1,
  "description": "Wish a friend a happy birthday",
  "name_localizations": {
    "zh-CN": "生日",
    "el": "γενέθλια"
  },
  "description_localizations": {
    "zh-CN": "祝你朋友生日快乐"
  },
  "options": [
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": 4,
      "description": "Your friend's age",
      "name_localizations": {
        "zh-CN": "岁数"
      },
      "description_localizations": {
        "zh-CN": "你朋友的岁数"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Retrieving localized commands

While most endpoints that return application command objects will return the ```name_localizations``` and ```description_localizations``` fields, some will not by default. This includes ```GET``` endpoints that return all of an application's guild or global commands. Instead, those endpoints will supply additional ```name_localized``` or ```description_localized``` fields, which only contain the localization relevant to the requester's locale. (The full dictionaries can still be obtained by supplying the appropriate query argument).

For example, if a batch ```GET``` request were made with locale ```zh-CN```, including the above command, the returned object would look as follows:

```
{
  "name": "birthday",
  "type": 1,
  "description": "Wish a friend a happy birthday",
  "name_localized": "生日",
  "description_localized": "祝你朋友生日快乐",
  "options": [
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": 4,
      "description": "Your friend's age",
      "name_localized": "岁数",
      "description_localized": "你朋友的岁数",
    }
  ]
}
```

If the requester's locale is not found in a localizations dictionary, then the corresponding ```name_localization``` or ```description_localization``` for that field will also not be present.

Locale is determined by looking at the ```X-Discord-Locale``` header, then the ```Accept-Language``` header if not present, then lastly the user settings locale.

## Age-Restricted Commands

A command that contains age-restricted content should have the [```nsfw``` field](https://ptb.discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-structure) set to ```true``` upon creation or update. Marking a command as age-restricted will limit who can see and access the command, and from which channels.

Apps with [discovery enabled](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9489299950487) (which is required to appear in the App Directory) cannot contain any age-restricted commands or content.

## Using Age-Restricted Commands

To use an age-restricted command, a user must be 18 years or older and access the command from either:

*   an [age-restricted channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115000084051-Age-Restricted-Channels-and-Content) or
*   a DM with the app after [enabling age-restricted commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10123937946007) within their User Settings.

Details about accessing and using age-restricted commands is in [the Help Center](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10123937946007).
